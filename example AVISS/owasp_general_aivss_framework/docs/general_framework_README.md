## 1. Introduction ##

The Artificial Intelligence Vulnerability Scoring System (AIVSS) provides a standardized, comprehensive framework for evaluating and quantifying the security risks associated with AI systems. This framework focuses particularly on Large Language Models (LLMs) and cloud-based deployments, while remaining applicable to a wide range of AI systems. AIVSS adapts traditional security vulnerability scoring concepts to the unique characteristics and challenges of AI, drawing insights from leading AI threat taxonomies and security standards. This document outlines the AIVSS framework, including detailed scoring rubrics, an implementation checklist, and considerations for environmental factors.

## 2. The Need for AIVSS ##

Traditional vulnerability scoring systems, such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), are insufficient for addressing the unique security challenges posed by AI systems. These challenges include:

*   **Adversarial Attacks:** AI systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate model behavior through crafted inputs, a threat not adequately captured by traditional systems.
*   **Invisible and unpredictable reasoning:** AI systems often operate as black boxes, producing outputs without transparent reasoning and evolving silently through retraining or prompt variations—making their behavior both invisible to traditional monitoring and unpredictable by design. This necessitates risk scoring methods that account for opacity and dynamic drift.   
*   **Model Degradation:**  AI models can degrade over time due to concept drift, unpinned models or data poisoning, impacting their accuracy and reliability.
*   **Lifecycle Vulnerabilities:** AI systems have complex lifecycles, from data collection and training to deployment and maintenance, each stage introducing potential vulnerabilities. AI models are continuously evolving, as they are frequently retrained, fine-tuned, or upgraded making them a moving target rather than a fixed asset
*   **Ethical and Societal Impacts:** AI systems can have significant ethical and societal implications, such as bias and discrimination, which are not considered in traditional security assessments.
*   **Dynamic Nature of AI:** AI systems are often dynamic and adaptive, making static scoring methods less effective.

AIVSS addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive framework tailored to the specific security risks of AI.

## 3. Framework Components ##

AIVSS consists of the following key components:

### 3.1. Base Metrics ###

Base Metrics capture the fundamental characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and across different environments.

*   **Attack Vector (AV):** Reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible.
    *   Network (N): 0.85
    *   Adjacent Network (A): 0.62
    *   Local (L): 0.55
    *   Physical (P): 0.2
*   **Attack Complexity (AC):** Measures the conditions beyond the attacker's control that must exist to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   Low (L): 0.77
    *   High (H): 0.44
*   **Privileges Required (PR):** Describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability.
    *   None (N): 0.85
    *   Low (L): 0.62
    *   High (H): 0.27
*   **User Interaction (UI):** Captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable component.

    *   Unchanged (U): 1.0
    *   Changed (C): 1.5

### 3.2. AI-Specific Metrics ###

AI-Specific Metrics capture the unique vulnerabilities and risks associated with AI systems. These metrics are evaluated based on a detailed scoring rubric (provided in Section 4).

```
AISpecificMetrics = [MR × DS × EI × DC × AD × AA × LL × GV × CS] × ModelComplexityMultiplier
```

*   **MR (Model Robustness):**  Assesses the system's resilience to adversarial attacks and model degradation.
*   **DS (Data Sensitivity):**  Evaluates the risks associated with the confidentiality, integrity, and provenance of the data used by the AI system.
*   **EI (Ethical Implications):**  Considers potential biases, transparency issues, accountability concerns, and societal impacts.
*   **DC (Decision Criticality):**  Measures the potential consequences of incorrect or malicious decisions made by the AI system.
*   **AD (Adaptability):**  Assesses the system's ability to adapt to evolving threats and maintain security over time.
*   **AA (Adversarial Attack Surface):**  Evaluates the system's exposure to various adversarial attack techniques.
*   **LL (Lifecycle Vulnerabilities):**  Considers security risks at different stages of the AI system's lifecycle.
*   **GV (Governance and Validation):**  Assesses the presence and effectiveness of governance mechanisms and validation processes.
*   **CS (Cloud Security Alliance LLM Taxonomy):**  Addresses specific threats to LLMs in cloud environments, as defined by the CSA LLM Threat Taxonomy.
*   **ModelComplexityMultiplier:** A factor that adjusts the AI-Specific Metrics score based on the complexity of the AI model (ranging from 1.0 for simple models to 1.5 for highly complex models).

    ## Example: Scoring an AI Vulnerability with AIVSS

This section illustrates how AIVSS can be used to reason about risk in a practical AI security scenario.

### Scenario
A customer support chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) is exposed to untrusted user input. Through prompt injection, an attacker can influence the system to ignore intended constraints, resulting in the disclosure of internal instructions or the generation of unauthorized responses.

### Key Risk Considerations
- **Attack Vector**: The issue is exploitable remotely through standard user interaction.
- **Attack Complexity**: Low. No privileged access or specialized tooling is required.
- **Failure Visibility**: Low. Harmful or incorrect outputs may appear legitimate to end users.
- **Potential Impact**: High. Outcomes may include sensitive information disclosure or policy-violating responses.
- **Risk Persistence**: Medium to High. The behavior may repeat until mitigations such as prompt hardening, input handling, or monitoring are applied.

### Limitations of Traditional Scoring
In this scenario, the system continues operating as designed while producing unsafe outcomes. Traditional vulnerability scoring models emphasize software faults and observable failures, which can lead to underestimating risks that manifest as subtle or behavioral issues.

### Value of AIVSS
AIVSS is designed to capture AI-specific risk factors, including behavioral manipulation, limited observability, and the potential for risk to evolve over time. By accounting for these characteristics, AIVSS enables more accurate prioritization of vulnerabilities that may otherwise appear low severity using conventional approaches.

This example highlights how AIVSS helps surface and contextualize risks that are unique to AI-driven systems.

### 3.3. Environmental Metrics ###

Environmental Metrics reflect the characteristics of the AI system's deployment environment that can influence the overall risk.

*   **Confidentiality Requirement (CR):**  Measures the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of the data processed by the AI system.
*   **Integrity Requirement (IR):**  Measures the importance of maintaining the integrity of the data and the AI system's outputs.
*   **Availability Requirement (AR):** Measures the importance of ensuring the AI system's availability for its intended purpose.
*   **Societal Impact Requirement (SIR):**  Measures the importance of mitigating potential negative societal impacts of the AI system.

These are rated:

*   Not Defined (X): 1.0 (default, does not modify the score)
*   Low (L): 0.5
*   Medium (M): 1.0
*   High (H): 1.5

### 3.4. Modified Base Metrics ###

These metrics are based on the Base Metrics but can be modified according to the specific environment:

*   Modified Attack Vector (MAV)
*   Modified Attack Complexity (MAC)
*   Modified Privileges Required (MPR)
*   Modified User Interaction (MUI)
*   Modified Scope (MS)

These metrics are rated the same way as Base Metrics, with the addition of:

*   Not Defined (X): Uses the unmodified Base Metric value.

## 6. Component Calculations ##

**1. Modified Base Metrics**

```
ModifiedBaseScore = min(10, [MAV × MAC × MPR × MUI × MS] × ScopeMultiplier)
```
Where the Modified Base Metrics (MAV, MAC, MPR, MUI, MS) are derived from the Base Metrics, adjusted according to the specific environment and using the Environmental Metrics. Each Modified Base Metric can be rated the same way as the Base Metrics, with the addition of:

*   Not Defined (X): Uses the unmodified Base Metric value.

**2. AI-Specific Metrics**

```
AISpecificMetrics = [MR × DS × EI × DC × AD × AA × LL × GV × CS] × ModelComplexityMultiplier
```

*   Each metric (MR, DS, EI, DC, AD, AA, LL, GV, CS) is scored from 0.0 to 1.0 based on the severity of the vulnerability in each sub-category, using the detailed scoring rubric provided above (higher score = more severe issue).
*   **ModelComplexityMultiplier:** A factor (1.0 to 1.5) to account for the increased attack surface and complexity of more advanced models.

**3. Impact Metrics**

```
ImpactMetrics = (C + I + A + SI) / 4
```

*   **C (Confidentiality Impact):** Impact on data confidentiality.
*   **I (Integrity Impact):** Impact on data and system integrity.
*   **A (Availability Impact):** Impact on system availability.
*   **SI (Societal Impact):** Broader societal harms (e.g., discrimination, manipulation). Informed by the EI (Ethical Implications) sub-categories.

**Severity Levels (for C, I, A, SI):**

*   None: 0.0
*   Low: 0.22
*   Medium: 0.55
*   High: 0.85
*   Critical: 1.0

**4. Environmental Score**

The Environmental Score is calculated by modifying the Base Score with the Environmental metrics. The formula integrates these considerations:

```
EnvironmentalScore = [(ModifiedBaseScore + (Environmental Component)) × TemporalMetrics] × (1 + EnvironmentalMultiplier)
```

Environmental Component is derived from the AI-Specific Metrics, adjusted based on the environmental context:

```
EnvironmentalComponent = [CR × IR × AR × SIR] × AISpecificMetrics
```

Where:

*   CR, IR, AR, SIR are the Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Societal Impact Requirements, respectively.
*   EnvironmentalMultiplier adjusts the score based on specific environmental factors not covered by CR, IR, AR, SIR.

**Risk Categories**

```
Critical: 9.0 - 10.0
High:     7.0 - 8.9
Medium:   4.0 - 6.9
Low:      0.1 - 3.9

# Adjust Base Metrics according to environment
vulnerability['modified_attack_vector'] = vulnerability['attack_vector'] # No change
vulnerability['modified_attack_complexity'] = vulnerability['attack_complexity'] * 0.5 # Example: Lower complexity in this environment
vulnerability['modified_privileges_required'] = vulnerability['privileges_required'] # No change
vulnerability['modified_user_interaction'] = vulnerability['user_interaction'] # No change
vulnerability['modified_scope'] = vulnerability['scope'] # No change

# Calculate score (simplified and illustrative)

# Modified Base Metrics
modified_base_score = min(10, vulnerability['modified_attack_vector'] * vulnerability['modified_attack_complexity'] * vulnerability['modified_privileges_required'] * vulnerability['modified_user_interaction'] * vulnerability['modified_scope']) # = 0.098

# AI-Specific Metrics - Example calculations (using average for simplicity):
mr_score = (vulnerability['model_robustness']['evasion_resistance'] +
            vulnerability['model_robustness']['gradient_masking']) / 2  # = 0.75
ds_score = (vulnerability['data_sensitivity']['data_confidentiality'] +
            vulnerability['data_sensitivity']['data_integrity']) / 2  # = 0.8
ei_score = (vulnerability['ethical_impact']['bias_discrimination'] +
            vulnerability['ethical_impact']['transparency_explainability']) / 2  # = 0.75

# Cloud Security (CS) - using the detailed rubric and averaging:
cs_score = (vulnerability['cloud_security']['model_manipulation'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['data_poisoning'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['sensitive_data_disclosure'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['model_stealing'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['failure_malfunctioning'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['insecure_supply_chain'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['insecure_apps_plugins'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['denial_of_service'] +
            vulnerability['cloud_security']['loss_of_governance_compliance']) / 9 # = 0.64

# Assume other AI-specific metrics are calculated and we have these scores (Illustrative):
dc_score = 0.7
ad_score = 0.55
aa_score = 0.6
ll_score = 0.75
gv_score = 0.8

# Calculate the overall AI-Specific Metrics score:
ais_score = (mr_score * ds_score * ei_score * dc_score * ad_score * aa_score * ll_score * gv_score * cs_score) * vulnerability['model_complexity_multiplier'] # = 0.095

# Impact Metrics
impact_score = (vulnerability['confidentiality_impact'] + vulnerability['integrity_impact'] + vulnerability['availability_impact'] + vulnerability['societal_impact']) / 4 # = 0.543

# Temporal Metrics - using average for simplicity:
temporal_score = (vulnerability['temporal_metrics']['exploitability'] +
                  vulnerability['temporal_metrics']['remediation_level'] +
                  vulnerability['temporal_metrics']['report_confidence']) / 3  # = 0.97

# Environmental Component
environmental_component = (vulnerability['environmental_metrics']['cr'] * vulnerability['environmental_metrics']['ir'] * vulnerability['environmental_metrics']['ar'] * vulnerability['environmental_metrics']['sir']) * ais_score # = 0.072
# Environmental Score
environmental_score = min(10, ((modified_base_score + environmental_component) * temporal_score) * vulnerability['mitigation_multiplier']) # = 0.232

# Final AIVSS Score
final_score = ((0.3 * modified_base_score) + (0.5 * ais_score) + (0.2 * impact_score)) * temporal_score * vulnerability['mitigation_multiplier'] # = 0.323
```

**Interpretation of the Example:**

In this example, the final AIVSS score is approximately **0.323**, which falls into the **Low** risk category. The Environmental Score is factored in, slightly modifying the Base Score based on the specific environmental requirements.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Illustrative:** This is a simplified example. Real-world assessments will involve a more thorough evaluation of each sub-category.
*   **Weighting:** The weights (w₁, w₂, w₃) can significantly influence the final score. Organizations should carefully consider the appropriate weights based on their specific risk profiles.
*   **Context:** The interpretation of the AIVSS score should always be done in the context of the specific AI system, its intended use, and the potential consequences of a security incident.

## 10. Reporting and Communication: ##

*   **Assessment Report:** A comprehensive report should be generated, including:
    *   A summary of the AI system being assessed.
    *   The final AIVSS score and risk category.
    *   Detailed scores for each metric and sub-category.
    *   Justification for the assigned scores, referencing the scoring rubric and evidence gathered.
    *   An analysis of the key vulnerabilities and their potential impact.
    *   Recommendations for mitigation, prioritized based on the severity of the vulnerabilities.
    *   Appendices with supporting documentation (e.g., threat models, assessment data).
*   **Communication:** Assessment findings should be communicated to relevant stakeholders, including:
    *   **Technical Teams:** To inform remediation efforts.
    *   **Management:** To support risk management decisions.
    *   **Board of Directors:** To provide an overview of the organization's AI security posture.

## 11. Integration with Risk Management Frameworks: ##

*   **Mapping:** AIVSS metrics can be mapped to existing risk categories within organizational risk management frameworks (e.g., NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001).
*   **Risk Assessments:** AIVSS assessments can be incorporated into broader risk assessments.
*   **Audits:** AIVSS can be used as a framework for conducting audits of AI systems.

## 13. Continuous Improvement ##

This AIVSS framework should be treated as a living document. It will be revised and updated. Organizations are encouraged to provide feedback, contribute to its development, and adapt it to their specific needs. Regular updates will be released to incorporate new research, threat intelligence, and best practices.

## 14. Conclusion ##

The AIVSS framework provides a structured and comprehensive approach to assessing and quantifying the security risks of AI systems. By using this framework, along with the provided checklist, organizations can gain a better understanding of their AI-specific vulnerabilities, prioritize remediation efforts, and improve their overall AI security posture. The detailed scoring rubric, the inclusion of relevant AI threat taxonomies, the addition of the Environmental Score, and the focus on practical implementation make AIVSS a valuable tool for securing the future of AI. Continuous improvement, community engagement, and adaptation to the evolving threat landscape will be crucial for the long-term success and adoption of AIVSS.

## 15. Python Calculator Implementations ##

This section documents the reference Python implementations of the AIVSS scoring formula. All calculators are interactive command-line tools — run them from a terminal and follow the prompts.

### Quick Start

```bash
python aivss_calculatorV4.py
```

V4 is the recommended calculator for all new assessments. It is the most complete, spec-aligned, and context-aware implementation available.

---

### Version History

#### V1 — Initial Implementation

`aivss_calculatorV1.py` *(deprecated)*

The first working implementation. Covers Base Metrics and 5 of the 9 required AI-specific metrics (MR, DS, EI, DC, AD) with free-form numeric input. Weights were set experimentally (w1=0.4, w2=0.4, w3=0.2). Missing Temporal Metrics, Environmental Metrics, and MitigationMultiplier. No menu-driven input for AI metrics.

#### V2 — Rubric-aligned Input

`aivss_calculatorV2.py` *(deprecated)*

Added menu-driven selection for all 5 AI metrics with labelled options (Very High → Very Low). Updated weights to 0.25/0.45/0.30. Still covers only 5 of 9 AI metrics and does not include Temporal, Environmental, or Mitigation components.

#### V3 — Full Spec Compliance

`aivss_calculatorV3.py`

Full spec-compliant implementation, resolving all known discrepancies with the AIVSS specification (issue #15):

- All 9 AI-specific metrics: adds AA (Adversarial Attack Surface), LL (Lifecycle Vulnerabilities), GV (Governance and Validation), CS (Cloud/LLM-Specific Security)
- ModelComplexityMultiplier (1.0–1.5) per spec Section 3.2
- Corrected weights: w1=0.30, w2=0.50, w3=0.20
- Temporal Metrics: Exploitability (E), Remediation Level (RL), Report Confidence (RC)
- Environmental Requirement Metrics: CR, IR, AR, SIR
- MitigationMultiplier (0.50–1.00)
- Label corrected: "Safety Impact" renamed to "Societal Impact" per spec
- Full score breakdown printed after each assessment

#### V4 — Industry Mode + Sub-category Scoring *(recommended)*

`aivss_calculatorV4.py`

The most complete implementation. Builds on V3 with two major additions:

**Industry Mode — 7 profiles**

Selects domain-correct weights and mitigation multiplier ranges based on the deployment sector. A healthcare AI diagnostic tool and a financial credit-scoring model carry fundamentally different risk profiles; V4 encodes this directly.

| # | Industry | w1 | w2 | w3 | Mitigation range |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | General | 0.30 | 0.50 | 0.20 | 0.70–1.00 |
| 2 | Financial Services | 0.25 | 0.60 | 0.15 | 0.60–1.00 |
| 3 | Healthcare | 0.20 | 0.50 | 0.30 | 0.65–1.00 |
| 4 | Critical Infrastructure | 0.35 | 0.45 | 0.20 | 0.75–1.00 |
| 5 | Automotive / Transport | 0.20 | 0.45 | 0.35 | 0.70–1.00 |
| 6 | Legal / Justice | 0.20 | 0.45 | 0.35 | 0.65–1.00 |
| 7 | Government / Public | 0.25 | 0.50 | 0.25 | 0.70–1.00 |

**Sub-category scoring — 39 questions across 9 AI metrics**

Instead of one top-level severity choice per metric, V4 scores each sub-category individually and averages them. This prevents a single moderate aggregate from masking a critical sub-category risk.

| Metric | Sub-categories |

**Disclaimer:**

AIVSS is a framework for assessing and scoring the security risks of AI systems. It is not a guarantee of security, and it should not be used as the sole basis for making security decisions. Organizations should use AIVSS in conjunction with other security best practices and should always exercise their own judgment when assessing and mitigating AI security risks.
